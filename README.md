# ROS 2 Mobile Robotics Projects

This repository contains my implementation of robotics projects from the Udemy course  
**"Self Driving and ROS 2 ‚Äì Learn by Doing! Odometry & Control"** by *Antonio Brandi*.

Each course section is organized as its own ROS 2 package inside the `src/` directory and includes my own notes, experiments, and code written during the course.
